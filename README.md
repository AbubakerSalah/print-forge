This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
# PrintForge

PrintForge is your go-to platform for discovering and sharing 3D printing files. Join our community of creators and explore a vast library of user-submitted models. Whether you're new to 3D printing or a seasoned maker, PrintForge offers an open space for creativity and collaboration. 

The platform is built using **Next.js** and **TypeScript**, ensuring a fast, scalable, and type-safe experience. The styling is powered by **Tailwind CSS**, and fonts are optimized using **Next/font** for enhanced performance. The Figma design for the platform was created by **Scrimba** as part of a learning project while studying Next.js.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
