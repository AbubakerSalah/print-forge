This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
# PrintForge – Frontend Demo

PrintForge is a demo project I built to practice working with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It’s a static site with multiple pages and clean routing, designed to showcase responsive layouts and a smooth user experience.

The project is based on a Figma design from Scrimba, which I implemented while learning Next.js. I also used Next/font for better performance and typography. While it doesn’t include backend features, the focus here is on building a polished frontend that could be expanded into a full platform in the future.



## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
